# d-games
Terminal games and utilities, written in D. WIP.
Just a little fun project I fancied doing, a standalone binary that contains a bunch of simple games and gaming-related-tools for terminals.
# Current
    Games:
        lights - Try to flip all the lights.
               - Takes options: --length:num defines how many lights, --loop:true defines if the ends loop around

    Tools:
        dice - Give a dice notation and roll the dice. (Default: 2d6) 
        deck [pack] - Opens a simulated deck of cards interface.(Default Pack: standard) 
        decks - Shows valid packs available for the deck command.

# Todo
